;; A nim-like game has a game identifier (usually a keyword), a title, a start state, an end state, a set of rules that indicate which states
;; may follow a given state (or set of states). It may also have a partition mechanism which
;; allows the game to be split into a disjunctive sum of nim heaps.
;;
;; Fields in this record are designed to be easily configurable (e.g. in a url), so follower rules
;; and heap-equivalent rules are generated from the game id.
